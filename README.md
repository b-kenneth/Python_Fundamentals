### **Conclusions**
1. **Franchise Movies Dominate**:
   - Franchises like *The Avengers* and *Harry Potter* consistently outperform standalone movies in terms of revenue.
   - However, standalone movies often achieve higher mean ratings.

2. **Genres Differ in ROI**:
   - Animated and Horror movies offer the highest ROI due to lower production costs.
   - Action movies, while revenue-rich, tend to have lower ROI due to massive budgets.

3. **Yearly Trends**:
   - Total revenue has grown significantly over the years, driven by blockbuster releases.
   - Budgets have also risen, reflecting the growing scale of movie production.
